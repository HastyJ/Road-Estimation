Autonomous Driving: Road-Estimation

Data file can be obtained from: 
http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php 
(Download base kit with: left color images, calibration and training labels (0.5 GB))

Data split:
60% training, 10% validation, 30% testing

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to investigate machine learning techniques to solve this task. Try things that we have seen in class and feel free to also try other techniques. Write in your report what you have done, what you observe, what you have tried, why you did what you did, etc.

Make a section of your report about what would you do to scale what you have done to work with pixels, as in that case you have millions of examples. You don’t need to implement anything but add a discussion of your ideas
