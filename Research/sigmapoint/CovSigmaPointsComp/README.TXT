Description

This package includes an implementation of the Sigma Points feature representation, 
derived from covariance descriptors. For a detailed technical description see 
S. Kluckner, T. Mauthner, P. M. Roth, and H. Bischof: "Semantic Classification 
in Aerial Imagery by Integrating Appearance and Height Information", In Proc. 
Asian Conference on Computer Vision, 2009. 
This paper is available at http://www.icg.tugraz.at/Members/kluckner.

The Matlab wrapper of CovSigmaPointsComp uses the MatLab MEX ObjectHandle
package, online available at http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/tbailey/software/other.htm

Compilation: mex integralWrapper.cpp
The library was developed under Linux, 64bit, but it should also work on other
operating systems.
